## :scroll: Description
In this app we can browse through some very famous doggos, see
their carefully selected profile pictures, and read some things that
these friends have written about themselves! :dog:


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
While in the process of understanding Jetpack Compose, actually putting
a puppy app together as part of a challenge, was a nice way to get
comfortable with Compose.
